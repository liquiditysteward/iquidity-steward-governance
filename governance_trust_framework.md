# 🧱 Liquidity Steward Governance Trust Framework

## Purpose

This document outlines the trust model behind Liquidity Steward's governance. It defines how the system maintains long-term credibility and decision quality through **objective AI oversight**, **outcome-based accountability**, **transparent voter records**, and **aligned incentives** for positive participation.

---

## 🔒 Pillar 1: Objective AI Oversight

> Every proposal is reviewed by an automated, impartial agent that performs structured due diligence.

### Responsibilities of the AI Agent:
- **Backtest proposed parameters** over relevant historical data
- Evaluate risks (e.g., volatility exposure, capital efficiency, execution impact)
- Identify edge cases, historical analogs, or contradictory trends
- Generate a **due diligence report** included with every proposal

This ensures every proposal is:
- **Data-backed**, not purely opinion-driven
- **Auditable**, even before execution
- **Understandable**, with standardized output for voters

---

## 📊 Pillar 2: Outcome-Based Accountability

> Proposals must define **measurable KPIs** that can be evaluated after a defined time window.

### Every proposal includes:
- A **target evaluation period** (e.g., 30 days, 90 days)
- A set of **clear, objective outcomes** (e.g., lower volatility, higher liquidity, increased buy-side depth)
- An **automated evaluation process** triggered at the end of the period

Results are permanently recorded and linked to:
- The **original proposer**
- The **parameter set**
- The **vote outcome and individual voter records**

---

## 🧑‍⚖️ Pillar 3: Transparent, Accountable Voting

> DAO members must be on-record for how they voted. Voting performance is tracked over time.

### Governance Participation Model:
- **Doxed or verified voters** (can be through KYC, DAO reputation, or on-chain identity)
- Every **vote is public** and tied to wallet identity
- Voting records are scored based on how often voters supported successful vs. failed proposals

### Optional Enforcements:
- **Inactive voters** lose influence or face cooldowns
- **Consistently misaligned voters** lose privileges or reputation
- **High-performing voters** earn more influence, proposal priority, or financial rewards

---

## 💰 Pillar 4: Incentives for Aligned Behavior

> Both proposers and voters must have strong upside for supporting good policy.

### Proposal-Defined Rewards
- Reward structures are included as part of the proposed parameters.
- Every proposal must define:
  - A **performance evaluation window**
  - **Success metrics** (e.g., volatility reduction, liquidity improvement)
  - A **reward pool** (e.g., in USD or token equivalent)
  - A **distribution split** (e.g., % to proposer, % to supportive voters, % to the Liquidity Steward DAO to fund ongoing operations)

### Proposer Rewards
- If a proposal **meets or exceeds** its stated goals:
  - The proposer receives a **performance bounty** (as defined in the proposal)
  - Reputation score increases

### Voter Rewards
- Voters who **support successful proposals** receive:
  - Reward multipliers based on proposal-defined terms
  - Long-term influence boost (governance weight or priority)

### Governance Incentive Pool
- A % of protocol revenue may be set aside to fund:
  - Proposal-defined reward pools
  - Performance-based leaderboards
  - DAO tools maintainers, auditors, and policy contributors
