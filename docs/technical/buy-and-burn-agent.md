# 🔥 Buy and Burn Agent for Inflationary Token Markets

## Summary

The Buy and Burn Agent is an automated mechanism within the Liquidity Steward framework designed to **combat inflationary pressure** in token ecosystems. It operates by **buying tokens from the open market** and **permanently removing them from circulation** through a burn process.

This agent is governed using the same **confidential parameter voting** system as other agents in Liquidity Steward, enabling strategic discretion, anti-gaming protections, and transparent post-facto verification.

## 🎯 Objectives

| Goal                    | Description                                                              |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔥 Reduce inflation     | Offset token supply growth by programmatically burning tokens            |
| 🪙 Support token value  | Absorb sell-side pressure in down markets                                |
| 🧠 Prevent exploitation | Use randomized execution and hidden logic to avoid manipulation          |
| 🔎 Stay auditable       | Publish full trade and burn data after execution                         |

## 🧰 How It Works

### 1. **Funding Source**
- The DAO allocates a portion of its protocol revenue, treasury surplus, or whale exit proceeds to a burn reserve.

### 2. **Confidential Trigger Parameters**
- DAO members vote on when and how the Buy and Burn Agent activates:
  - Conditions (e.g. inflation thresholds, volume metrics)
  - Budget limits and timing
  - Burn methods (on-chain burns or send-to-zero)
- Parameters are encrypted and approved via commit-reveal voting.

### 3. **Execution Process**
- When a trigger condition is met:
  - The encrypted strategy is decrypted
  - The agent executes market buys using allocated funds
  - Purchased tokens are burned permanently

### 4. **Post-Execution Transparency**
- After execution:
  - The DAO reveals the decryption key
  - The plaintext strategy is published and validated
  - Burn transactions are confirmed on-chain

## ⚙️ Sample DAO-Governed Parameters (Encrypted)

| Parameter                   | Description                                                     |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `burn_trigger_pct`          | e.g. burn if supply grows > 2% in 30 days                       |
| `burn_budget_max_usd`       | Max funds allocated per activation                              |
| `min_volume_threshold`      | Require minimum market volume to avoid illiquid burn buys       |
| `burn_spread_cap`           | Don't buy tokens trading > X% above fair value                  |
| `execution_randomness`      | Randomize exact buy time within a window                        |
| `cooldown_after_burn`       | Delay before another burn can occur                             |

## 🧠 Anti-Gaming Safeguards

| Exploit Attempt                        | Defense Mechanism                                          |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pump price just before known burn      | Hidden timing + price guardrails                           |
| Front-run burn with large buys         | Execution randomized; volumes capped                       |
| Trigger artificial inflation metrics    | Require multiple signal confirmation (supply + volume)     |
| Sell into burn buys                    | Stealthy execution intervals; capped burn participation     |

## 🔍 Auditability + Trust

Every burn action is:
- Validated by revealing the matching hash of the original strategy
- Traceable via transaction logs (token buy + burn event)
- Fully auditable after execution with agent behavior matching DAO intent

> **"If you're inflating, we're incinerating."**

This Buy and Burn Agent reinforces sustainable tokenomics by helping inflationary tokens self-correct with community-approved automation. It integrates seamlessly with the Liquidity Steward framework and confidential governance system.
