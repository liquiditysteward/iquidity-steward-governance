## Purpose

This document outlines the governance framework for Liquidity Steward, DAO LLC. It defines how decisions are made, who participates, and how the system evolves from manual oversight to fully on-chain governance.

## üéØ Governance Objectives

- Ensure transparency and accountability
- Empower token holders and contributors
- Maintain DAO LLC compliance
- Transition from manual to fully on-chain governance

## üõ†Ô∏è Governance Phases

### Phase 1: Manual Oversight (Current)

**Duration**: Until governance contract deployment

**Structure**:
- Governed by founding member(s) (e.g., Steven G. Tingiris)
- Major decisions documented in this repository
- Financials published monthly
- Smart contract development prioritized

**Decision Process**:
- Proposals submitted as GitHub Issues
- 7-day community comment period
- Manual approval by founding member(s)
- All decisions publicly documented

**Responsibilities**:
- Treasury management (multi-sig wallet)
- Client onboarding and fee structure
- Smart contract development roadmap
- Legal compliance and reporting

---

### Phase 2: Hybrid Governance

**Trigger**: Governance contract deployment at pre-defined address

**Structure**:
- Token-weighted proposals/voting on key parameters
- Manual fallback retained for critical decisions
- Gradual transition of authority to on-chain governance

**Voting Areas**:
- **Fees**: Service fee structures and adjustments
- **Treasury**: Fund allocation and investment decisions
- **Client Onboarding**: Approval of new clients and exit strategies
- **Agent Parameters**: Updates to autonomous agent configurations

**Governance Token**:
- Non-transferable token (or soulbound NFT) for voting rights
- Granted to contributors and long-term stakeholders

**Decision Process**:
- On-chain proposals with encrypted parameters
- Commit-reveal voting mechanism
- Post-execution transparency and verification
- Manual override available for emergency situations
