[![Wyoming DAO LLC](https://img.shields.io/badge/WY--Registered--DAO--LLC-Active-brightgreen)](https://wyobiz.wyo.gov/business/FilingDetails.aspx?eFNum=096245037255134149108043243008151010166095216146)

> **Decentralized liquidity exit automation for token-based communities and DAOs**

---

## 🔍 Executive Summary

**Liquidity Steward, DAO LLC** is a Wyoming-registered decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that provides services to other DAOs and large token holders to help them exit large token positions in low-liquidity markets. The service is designed to minimize the impact on price when large token holders sell by using AI agents that are trained to exit over time—avoiding large market orders that could cause panic or slippage.

This repository outlines the governance framework and smart contract roadmap as required under W.S. 17‑31‑104.

## 🚀 Quick Start

- 📜 [Wyoming Secretary of State Filing](https://wyobiz.wyo.gov/business/FilingDetails.aspx?eFNum=096245037255134149108043243008151010166095216146)

## 🎯 Core Value Proposition

### The Problem
Token projects face two long-standing challenges:
1. **Managing large token sales** without disrupting the market
2. **Addressing inflationary pressures** without centralized intervention

### The Solution
Liquidity Steward offers a decentralized alternative: a programmable, policy-driven monetary engine governed by DAOs and enforced through autonomous agents.

> Like a decentralized Federal Reserve for tokens.

## 🧰 Key Components

### Autonomous Agents
- **Throttled Sellers**: Controlled exits for large token holders
- **Buyback Guardrail**: Counter-dump mechanism to absorb harmful sell pressure
- **Buy and Burn Agent**: Reduces inflation through strategic market buys and burns
- **Volatility Dampeners**: Pause agent activity during high volatility

### Governance System
- **Confidential Governance**: Parameters encrypted until execution
- **Commit-Reveal Voting**: Prevents gaming and manipulation
- **Post-Execution Transparency**: Full auditability after execution
- **AI Oversight**: Automated due diligence on all proposals
