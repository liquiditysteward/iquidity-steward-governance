> **Decentralized liquidity exit automation for token-based communities and DAOs**

---

## 🔍 Overview

**Liquidity Steward, DAO LLC** is a Wyoming-registered decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that provides services to other DAOs and large token holders to help them exit large token positions in low-liquidity markets. The service is designed to minimize the impact on price when large token holders sell by using AI agents that are trained to exit over time—avoiding large market orders that could cause panic or slippage.

This repository outlines the governance framework and smart contract roadmap as required under W.S. 17‑31‑104.
