# 🕶️ Liquidity Steward Confidential Governance Protocol

## Summary

This document defines a proposed protocol for **confidential DAO governance** and **obscured execution strategies** within the Liquidity Steward system. It is designed to:

- Prevent front-running by non-members and whales
- Minimize strategic leakage before execution
- Preserve post-facto transparency and trust

This mechanism combines **blind voting**, **encrypted strategy submission**, and **post-execution verification** to deliver a governance model that is private by design and verifiable by default.

## 🎯 Objectives

| Objective         | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔒 Pre-trade secrecy | Prevent actors from gaming strategy before execution                      |
| 🧾 Strategy integrity | Ensure executed behavior matches what the DAO approved                     |
| ⚖️ Fair governance   | Prevent coercion or manipulation during voting                             |
| 📜 Public auditability | Provide full verifiability *after* execution is complete                  |

## 🧰 System Components

### 1. **Proposal Creation**
- DAO member drafts execution strategy (e.g., "sell no more than 1.5% per day if volatility < 12%").
- Strategy is serialized and encrypted using a symmetric encryption key (e.g., AES).
- The encrypted payload is published on-chain or to IPFS.
- A hash of the plaintext strategy (commitment hash) is also stored to enable future verification.

### 2. **Blind Voting (Commit-Reveal)**
- Voting occurs in two phases:
  - **Commit Phase**: Voters submit a hash of their vote (e.g., `hash(vote_choice + salt)`).
  - **Reveal Phase**: Voters reveal their original vote and salt.
- Votes are counted only after reveal.
- Results are hidden until the reveal phase ends.

### 3. **Strategy Execution**
- If the proposal passes, the encrypted strategy is passed to execution agents.
- The strategy is decrypted **only when ready to execute**, using either:
  - Time-based unlock (e.g., key published after delay)
  - Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
  - Multi-Party Computation (MPC)

### 4. **Post-Execution Transparency**
- After execution, the decryption key is published.
- The plaintext strategy is revealed.
- DAO members and observers verify the decrypted strategy matches the original commitment hash.
- Trade execution logs are published for full transparency.

## 🔄 Optional Enhancements

- **Proposal Title Obfuscation**: Proposal metadata is hidden until execution.
- **Execution Randomization**: Agents randomize timing within approved bounds.
- **Voting Anonymity**: zk-based voter anonymity to prevent coercion.
- **Simulation Hashes**: Proposals include pre-submitted simulation results tied to the commit hash.

|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Execution matched proposal       | Commitment hash + post-execution decryption                 |
| Voter privacy during voting      | Commit-reveal protocol                                      |
| Proposal secrecy pre-execution   | Encrypted payload and time-delay decryption                 |
| Public audit after execution     | Full log + decrypted plaintext + matching commitment hash   |

## 🚨 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                                  | Mitigation                                                             |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Collusion outside DAO                 | Time-limited voting windows; voting anonymity                         |
| Malicious encrypted payload           | Simulations + optional proposal review council                        |
| Incomplete reveals                    | Penalties for failing to reveal or fallback threshold-based voting    |
| Oracle-based key publication attacks  | Use quorum-based unlock or distributed time-lock agents               |

## 🔚 Conclusion

This protocol balances the need for transparency with the need for strategic discretion. It enables token holders to govern liquidity policies in a way that is:
- Fair
- Verifiable
- Resistant to manipulation

It is intended as a foundational model for the Liquidity Steward DAO and may evolve with community input and implementation testing.
